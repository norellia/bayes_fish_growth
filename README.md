# Bayesian Fish Growth - Code Sample
This is an improved code sample from a Bayesian Statistics course I took using white perch growth curves from 4 South Carolina lakes.  

I developed 3 glms to run in JAGS to test which method is the best for estimating growth of White Perch in South Carolina.  

There are 2 ways to run the code: 
1. Open the RProj file and run the 2 .R scripts (cleanning, then finalized)
2. Knit the .Rmd file and look at the .html printout.  

Warning: Running the 3 models takes an hour or so, so I recommend just looking at the .html or running only Model 1.
